This is absolutely unacceptable! Our entire company has been unable to access the system for the past 3 hours. We're losing thousands of dollars every minute this is down.

We've been paying for your Enterprise plan for 5 years and this is the 3rd outage this month. If this isn't fixed immediately, we'll be forced to switch providers and pursue legal action for breach of contract.

We need someone to call us NOW at 555-0100.

Hi team,

Love your product! I was wondering if you could add a dark mode option? It would really help when I'm working late at night.

Also, it would be cool if you could export reports as PDF.

Thanks!

Hello,

I noticed I was charged $299 this month but my plan should only be $199. Can someone look into this? I've attached a screenshot of my billing page.

My account email is user@example.com

Please refund the difference.

Thanks,
Mike`
